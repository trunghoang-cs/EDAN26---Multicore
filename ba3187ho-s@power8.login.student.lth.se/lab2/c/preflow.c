/* This is an implementation of the preflow-push algorithm, by
 * Goldberg and Tarjan, for the 2021 EDAN26 Multicore programming labs.
 *
 * It is intended to be as simple as possible to understand and is
 * not optimized in any way.
 *
 * You should NOT read everything for this course.
 *
 * Focus on what is most similar to the pseudo code, i.e., the functions
 * preflow, push, and relabel.
 *
 * Some things about C are explained which are useful for everyone  
 * for lab 3, and things you most likely want to skip have a warning 
 * saying it is only for the curious or really curious. 
 * That can safely be ignored since it is not part of this course.
 *
 * Compile and run with: make
 *
 * Enable prints by changing from 1 to 0 at PRINT below.
 *
 * Feel free to ask any questions about it on Discord 
 * at #lab0-preflow-push
 *
 * A variable or function declared with static is only visible from
 * within its file so it is a good practice to use in order to avoid
 * conflicts for names which need not be visible from other files.

 * (i.e., the technical term array in ISO C) is declared as: int x[10],
 * i.e., with [size] but for convenience most people refer to the data
 * in memory as an array here despite the graph_t's v and e members 
 * are not strictly arrays. they are pointers. once we have allocated
 * memory for the data in the ''array'' for the pointer, the syntax of
 * using an array or pointer is the same so we can refer to a node with
 *
 * 			g->v[i]
 *
 * where the -> is identical to Java's . in this expression.
 * 
 * in summary: just use the v and e as arrays.
 * 
 * a difference between C and Java is that in Java you can really not
 * have an array of nodes as we do. instead you need to have an array
 * of node references. in C we can have both arrays and local variables
 * with structs that are not allocated as with Java's new but instead
 * as any basic type such as int.
